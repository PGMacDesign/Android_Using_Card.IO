# Android_Using_Card.IO
This is utilizing the Card.IO library to scan and process credit cards via an image

I pulled the code for this to work directly from their SDK Github page located here: https://github.com/card-io/card.io-Android-SDK

Very useful app for scanning credit cards and saving said credit card data
